# WYHIWYS
This project aims to recreate a test by the Lund University in Sweden. 
You can use the files blau.py, grau.py and braun.py to record single words and 
the files playblau.py, playgrau.py and playbraun.py to play them. the play.py files are synchronized
with a presentation of the Stroop test that I have created but you can change the time values to fit any other test.

You'll need to install PyAudio to run the files.
